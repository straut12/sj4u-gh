# SJ4U
This website is my attempt to document, in one location, various STEM concepts I hope to incorporate in a Maker space some day. It contains tutorials and links to resources useful for learning STEM, with a focus on Raspberry Pi (and other Linux distros), Scratch, Python, javascript, and circuits. It is meant to be a reference tool and not a step-by-step guide. If you are interested in STEM and Linux, and want to learn more in those areas, then hopefully the information here will be useful.

My background is in engineering. I worked in semiconductor manufacturing and the computer science classes I took in college proved to be the most useful in my career. Those experiences grew an interest I’ve always had in STEM. I have learned a lot in the process and enjoy sharing that info with others. A large portion of the material on the site come from key resources I’ve learned from including wiki, stackexchange, w3schools, freecodecamp, etc.

# In-progress of converting from www.stemjust4u.com but eventually the following concepts will be covered
* Basic coding with Scratch
* Python
* MicroPython
* JavaScript (focused on nodered application)
* HTML/CSS
* NodeRed
* MQTT
* InfluxDB
* Raspberry Pi
* esp32
* VNC/Remote Connect
* Linux (how to install dual boot, how to install programs, etc.)
* Circuits
* Data analysis
* VS Code
* GitHub

Projects include additional hardware
* Led controls
* DHT11/22 temp/humidity sensor
* Thermocouple
* INA219 (voltage, current sensor)
* ADC (analog to digital with ADS1115)
* Servo (SG90 and esp32 or RPi with PCA9685)
* Stepper motor (28BYJ-48-ULN2003 Driver)
* Eink display (waveshare e-ink screen)
* Rotary Encoder

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
