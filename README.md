ABOUT
With two-and-a-half decades of experience as a photolithography engineer, including an extensive 18-year tenure at Texas Instruments, I’ve developed expertise in data analysis and process optimization. Throughout my career, I’ve been driven by a passion for efficiency, seeking innovative solutions to streamline processes for both myself and fellow engineers. My comprehensive grasp of photolithography and my ability to harness the power of programming for data-driven insights have been instrumental in achieving these goals. I am committed to delivering cutting-edge solutions and fostering a culture of efficiency. I would love to connect with you so that we can explore how my skill set could enhance your team’s capabilities and drive continued success for your organization.

Example of engineering dashboard using Python data analysis tools.
Example Engineering Dashboard (Python-dash with plotly, pandas, and numpy for data tables and visualizations. Scikit learn models used to predict edge of wafer. Pair-wise Tukey HSD calculations used to run unit comparison and highlight deltas.)
Example of Tool Commonality Analysis (Used Python in Excel with various classification models to run commonality analysis)

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
