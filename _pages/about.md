**EXPERIENCE**  
**Process Engineer at Texas Instruments DMOS6 300mm Fab (2001-2019)**  
* Lead photo engineer - Startup of TI’s first 300mm fab focused on CMOS Cu back end technologies ranging from; and 135nm FeRAM technology. Qualified 250nm analog technology (aluminum back end),   
* Qualified and optimized critical processes in Photo for i-line, 248nm, and 193nm process.  Including ASML scanner, FSI/DNS RF3/TEL Lithius track, KLA bright field inspection (Stealth), KLA macro inspection (Viper), KLA Archer overlay, KLA CD SEM, and AMAT CD SEM.
* Worked on solutions for top photo issues (both front end and back end of line).  Owned 20+ levels with focus on BEOL that included both Cu damascene levels and Aluminum.  Responsibilities included new process setup and characterization (including OPC), tool release, new device setups, sustaining, chart monitoring (responsible for 300+ charts), optimization of coat, bake, develop, and rinse recipes for defect and CD improvements.
* Performed multiple resist/BARC evaluations for process improvements and cost savings. Evaluated multiple planarizing via fill products for Dual Damascene technology.
* Converted Trench pattern layers from 193nm process to 248nm for cost savings.
* Various times responsible for all metrology (macro inspect, overlay, SEM).  Wrote programs to automatically create metrology recipes for KLA Archer overlay to save significant man hours.  Created recipes on KLA Stealth for photo pattern inspections (used as tool monitors).

**Leader of Cross-Functional Teams**  
* DMOS6 Back-End-Of-Line Engineering Group (Al and Cu metal loops + bond pad loops) 
    * Responsible for coordinating fab equipment/process/integration/device/quality engineers to quickly and effectively resolve back-end of line issues.  Including base-line yield improvements, controlling defect/electrical/scrap excursions, customer returns, qual fails, and other quality issues.
    * Reliability improvements through improved BEOL integration, blocked etch reduction, reduction in CVD thin film defects, wafer break reduction efforts, etc.

**Change Control Board Member**  
* All changes to equipment or process have to be approved by the change control team before running split lots, limited release, and full implementation.  Met twice a week where engineers request approval for upcoming changes.  Reviewed the engineer’s proposal and data collected before forming a decision on how the project should proceed.

**OTHER EXPERIENCE**  
* Application Engineer at Brewer Science (Rolla, MO) - Global support for customer issues with DUV BARC. Assisted customers with new product development and implementation of the product.
* Photo Process Engineer at LSI Logic (Gresham, OR) - Started up LSI Logic first DUV process on DNS 200W with Nikon 201 1st generation scanner.  Performed TEL ACT8/DNS tool evaluations.
* Photo Process Engineer at TwinStar Semiconductor (Richardson, TX) - 200mm DRAM start up. Transferred DRAM technolgies (i-line) from Hitachi and worked on key defect projects to achieve benchmark yields.

**AWARDS**  
* Member of TI Technical Staff 
* Patent award TI-61230, titled DI WATER RINSE OF PHOTORESISTS WITH INSOLUBLE DYE 

**EDUCATION**
* Colorado School of Mines ▪ B.S. in Engineering (Mechanical)
