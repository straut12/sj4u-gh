**ABOUT**  
With two-and-a-half decades of experience as a photolithography engineer, including an extensive 18-year tenure at Texas Instruments, I've developed expertise in data analysis and process optimization. Throughout my career, I've been driven by a passion for efficiency, seeking innovative solutions to streamline processes for both myself and fellow engineers. My comprehensive grasp of photolithography and my ability to harness the power of programming for data-driven insights have been instrumental in achieving these goals. I am committed to delivering cutting-edge solutions and fostering a culture of efficiency. I would love to connect with you so that we can explore how my skill set could enhance your team's capabilities and drive continued success for your organization.

**DATA ANALYSIS SKILLSETS**
* Excel (with Python and VBA), Spotfire, Python, dash, colab, plotly, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, JavaScript, SQL, JMP, Power BI, PowerPoint  

**EXPERIENCE**  
**Process Engineer at Texas Instruments DMOS6 300mm Fab (2001-2019)**  
* Lead photo engineer - Startup of TI’s first 300mm fab. Focused on 248nm/193nm CMOS Cu BEOL process and later qualified FeRAM and analog technologies  
* Tool sets: Qualified and optimized processes in Photo for i-line, 248nm, and 193nm layers on ASML scanners (450, 850, 1050), FSI/DNS RF3/TEL Lithius track, KLA bright field inspection (Stealth), KLA macro inspection (Viper), KLA Archer overlay, KLA Spectra, KLA CD SEM, and AMAT CD SEM.
* Photo Process Ownership: Worked on solutions for top photo issues (both front end and back end of line).  Owned 20+ levels with focus on BEOL that included both Cu damascene levels and Aluminum.  Responsibilities included new process setup and characterization (including OPC), tool release, new device setups, sustaining, chart monitoring, Cp/Cpk improvements, optimization of coat, bake, develop, and rinse recipes for defect and CD improvements.
* Performed multiple resist/BARC evaluations for process improvements and cost savings. 
* Converted defect prone via fill products with cleaner and lower cost materials on Dual Damascene technologies.
* Converted Trench pattern layers from 193nm process to 248nm for cost savings.
* Various times responsible for all metrology (macro inspect, overlay, SEM).  Wrote programs to automatically create metrology recipes for KLA Archer overlay to save significant man hours.  Created recipes on KLA Stealth/Spectra for photo pattern inspections (used as tool monitors for defect and CD control).
* Co-developed metrology sampling system implemented fab-wide for cycle time improvements. 

**Cross-Functional Team Leader (Back-End-Of-Line Engineering Group)**  
* Responsible for coordinating fab equipment/process/integration/device/quality engineers to quickly and effectively resolve back-end-of-line issues.  Including base-line yield improvements, controlling defect/electrical/scrap excursions, customer returns, qual fails, and other quality issues.
* Reliability improvements through improved BEOL integration, blocked etch reduction, reduction in CVD thin film defects, wafer break reduction efforts, etc.

**Change Control Board Member**  
* Led weekly meetings to review engineering proposals for significant changes to equipment or process levels. Assessed the risk of proposed changes and worked with engineers to develop a safe plan for proceeding with on-product testing. Approval by change control team was required before running split lots, limited release, or full implementation of the changes.

**OTHER EXPERIENCE**  
* Application Engineer at Brewer Science (Rolla, MO) - Global support for customer issues with DUV BARC. Assisted customers with new product development and implementation of the product.
* Photo Process Engineer at LSI Logic (Gresham, OR) - Started up LSI Logic first DUV process on DNS 200W with Nikon 201 1st generation scanner.  Performed TEL ACT8/DNS tool evaluations.
* Photo Process Engineer at TwinStar Semiconductor (Richardson, TX) - 200mm DRAM start up. Transferred DRAM technologies (i-line) from Hitachi and worked on key defect projects to achieve benchmark yields.

**AWARDS**  
* Member of TI Technical Staff 
* Patent award TI-61230, titled DI WATER RINSE OF PHOTORESISTS WITH INSOLUBLE DYE 

**EDUCATION**
* Colorado School of Mines ▪ B.S. in Engineering (Mechanical) 1995
