# Node Red
[Node Red](https://nodered.org/) is a flow-based coding tool. It has a web browser-based editor where you connect different nodes to retrieve data, store data, make decisions, etc. A common setup is to use the 'mqtt in' node to listen for messages/data. Then, based on the mqtt message content (JSON format), other nodes can be connected to store the data in a database, send data to gauges/charts, use a 'mqtt out' node to send instructions (publish) to another microcontroller. To program node-red you can use both the built-in nodes or code-blocks with custom javascript code/functions. Using json along with loads/dumps makes it easy to transfer data between Python running on your microcontroller and node-red js.

Although node-red is installed on RPi's the node-red web site recommends using their script to setup on a RPi.  
```sudo apt install build-essential git ```  
```bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/linux-installers/master/deb/update-nodejs-and-nodered)  ```  
On Pi Node-RED works better with the Firefox or Chrome browser  
```node-red-stop ``` to stop Node-RED  
```node-red-start ``` to start Node-RED again  
```node-red-log ``` to view the recent log output   
```sudo systemctl enable nodered ``` to autostart Node-RED at every boot  
```sudo systemctl disable nodered ``` to disable autostart on boot  

```sudo reboot```  
To setup your node red flows go to **http://hostname.local:1880** (IP add = the address of RPi) on any device connected to the network.  
For influxdb and gauges/charts options go to menu in upper right and "manage pallette" then install  
* influxdb  
* node red dashboard  

Dashboard  
Once you have gauges/charts setup you can view them at **http://hostname.local:1880/ui**   

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/coding/nrchart.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/coding/nrgauge.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>  

# Grafana    
Most of the graphing I do is in node-red because it's convenient to setup while working on the main flow and the graphs are compact (look nice on mobile browser). But grafana is useful when you want the ability to zoom in closer and do more analysis. It also has functions to alert you based on conditions you configure.  

Installation  
Prerequisites  
```sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ```  
```sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common wget ```  

Add APT key used for authenticating the grafana package  
wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add - 
Add the grafana repository to your sources.list
echo "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list 
Download package information from the updated sources and install grafana
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install grafana 
Start the grafana server and enable it to start on boot
sudo systemctl start grafana-server 
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server 
Grafana runs on port 3000 so you can configure your database by going to http://hostname.local:3000
Initial login is admin/admin.
Configuration file is in /etc/grafana/grafana.ini

Add your first data source (influxDB)

    InfluxQL
    URL: http://localhost:8086
    Add a database
    Save and Test

â€‹Create/add panels in your dashboard

    Click on the title and edit (example below)
    FROM autogen mydb WHERE device = mcp3008
    SELECT field (a0f)
    On far right click "Show options" and then Visualation drop down to change graph type to gauge or bar, etc.
    Upper right in the referesh bar you can select 5s auto refresh (can't go smaller).

Adding plugin panels (ie plotly)
To avoid write permissions I used sudo which forced chown/chmod on the plugin files.
There is a better way to do this.. but this is what worked for me.
$ sudo grafana-cli plugins install <plugin-name>
$ sudo chown -R grafana:grafana /var/lib/grafana/plugins
$ sudo chmod -R 777 /var/lib/grafana/plugins (could try 742)
$ service grafana-server restart
Re open grafana and now panels were available
